# Facade Design Pattern

## Definition

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Example
### Video Files Converter

This example mocks a facade to convert files from one format to another. The idea is just to use our facade class: VideoConversionFacade instead of 
working with all the steps by ourselves. Facade covers that for us and is very much simplified.
